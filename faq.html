          <div class="content" data-section-content>
            <p>Fill out our registration form, receive a copy of our policies, and pay the tuition for that month.</p>

            <p>If you are inquiring over the phone about available time slots and want to secure a time slot you will need to come in and pay the Tuition in advance before we can assign you an instructor and put you in our scheduling system. You can also reserve the preferred day and Time slot over the phone using a Major Credit Card by paying a $20.00 Reservation Deposit. We then will reserve that time slot and schedule you the First lesson with the Instructor.</p>

            <p>After your lesson the balance of the Tuition will be due. If you fail to show for your first lesson the reservation deposit will be forfeited to compensate the instructors time. </p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">Are lessons open to all age groups?</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-section-content>
            <p>We have students ranging from 6 up to 74 years of age. You're never too young or old to learn an instrument. However, we recommend children start at 7 years of age for Guitar & Drums, 10 years of age for Bass Guitar, and 5 years of age for Piano. </p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">Can I monitor my child's lesson?</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-section-content>
            <p>Yes of course, parents have the option of sitting with the instructor in the studio, waiting outside in the lobby area, or viewing the lesson through a monitoring window. Older teenage students are dropped off while the parent shops and picks them up at a later time.</p>

            <p>We also will be installing a digital monitoring system in which all lessons will me recorded and a split screen monitor placed in the lobby for viewing. </p>

        <section>
          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">Do you recommend a 30 minute or a 1 hour lesson for beginners? </a></p>
          <div class="content" data-section-content>
            <p>I can cover more detailed information in an hourly lesson with teenage and adult students, but that's a personal decision. A 30 minute lesson is sufficient for a child's attention span.</p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">Do you do repairs or change strings? </a></p>

            <p>No we don't do major repairs, but we can re-string guitars, basses, violins, and provide drum maintenance. For Major Repairs we outsource the work to skilled local repairmen. </p>

          <p class="title" data-section-title><a href="#">If I have paid for lessons in advance and cannot make the lesson can I reschedule the lesson or get credit for that lesson?</a></p>
          <div class="content" data-section-content>
            <p>Yes, as long as you call 24 hours in advance and tell us you will not be able to make the lesson we will set up a make-up lesson. If a make-up lesson cannot be arranged then we will credit the lesson to the following month. We cannot guarantee the make-up lesson will be with the same instructor.
